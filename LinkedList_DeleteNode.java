/*

 a singly linked list and an integer x.Delete xth node from the singly linked list.

Example 1:

Input: 1 -> 3 -> 4 
       x = 3
Output: 1 -> 3
Explanation:
After deleting the node at 3rd
position (1-base indexing), the
linked list is as 1 -> 3. 
Example 2:

Input: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 9 
x = 2
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 9
Explanation: 
After deleting the node at 2nd
position (1-based indexing), the
linked list is as 1 -> 2 -> 9.
Your task: Your task is to complete the method deleteNode() which takes two arguments: the address of the head of the linked list and an integer x. The function returns the head of the modified linked list.

Constraints:
2 <= N <= 105
1 <= x <= N
